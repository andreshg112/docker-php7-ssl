## Securing the Database with ssl option and certificates ##
## There is no control over the protocol level used. ##
##  mariadb will use TLSv1.0 or better.  ##

ssl-cert=/etc/mysql/ssl/server-cert.pem
ssl-key=/etc/mysql/ssl/server-key.pem
## Set up TLS version here. For example TLS version 1.2 and 1.3 ##
